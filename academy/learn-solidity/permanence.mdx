# Permanence

Permanence is a fundamental characteristic of deployed smart contracts within the blockchain ecosystem. Once a smart contract has been deployed, it attains an immutable status, meaning it becomes impervious to any modifications or alterations, even by its original creators. The concept of permanence underscores the irreversible nature of smart contracts on the blockchain; once coded and deployed, they are set in stone, and no party, including the creators, possesses the capability to edit or update them.

This lack of editability introduces a unique challenge for smart contract developers. If vulnerabilities or issues are identified after deployment, there is no recourse for direct amendments. The only available action is often limited to withdrawing funds, provided the contract incorporates such functionality. This underscores the critical importance of rigorous testing, auditing, and thorough review processes prior to deployment. Developers need to ensure that the smart contract is robust and free from vulnerabilities, as any oversights become permanent and may have significant consequences.

In light of the permanence inherent in smart contracts, it has become a standard industry practice to subject these contracts to expert audits before deployment. This proactive measure aims to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that once deployed, smart contracts operate securely and as intended throughout their unalterable existence on the blockchain.
