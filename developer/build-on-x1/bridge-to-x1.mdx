# Bridge to X1
You can use [ZkEVM Bridge Contract](https://github.com/okx/x1-contracts/blob/release/v0.1.0/contracts/PolygonZkEVMBridge.sol "ZkEVM Bridge Contract") to bridge assets like ETH, OKB, and ERC-20 tokens between L1 and L2. However, there are a few points to note:：
- ETH is the native token of L1 (Ethereum). After bridging to L2 X1, it becomes a Wrapped ETH (WETH) ERC-20 token.
- OKB is an ERC-20 token of L1 (Ethereum). After bridging to L2 X1, it becomes a native token.
- Other ERC-20 tokens, which are bridged to the other side, remain ERC-20 tokens. You can calculate the new ERC-20 address by using the `precalculatedWrapperAddress` method.
- There are no restrictions if you are bridging ERC-20 tokens from L1 to L2. However, there is a whitelist restriction when bridging assets from L2 to L1. 

<Tip title="Note">If you want to request L2 to L1 token whitelisting, you can join our [X1 Discord server](https://discord.gg/x1-network "X1 Discord server"), and navigate to `#support-tickets` to raise whitelising request.</Tip>

The mapping list for OKB and ETH is as follows:
|ERC-20 Token|Testnet|Mainnet|
|:----|:----|:----|
|OKB|[0x3F4B6664338F23d2397c953f2AB4Ce8031663f80](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x3F4B6664338F23d2397c953f2AB4Ce8031663f80 "0x3F4B6664338F23d2397c953f2AB4Ce8031663f80") (L1 Ethereum Sepolia)|[0x75231f58b43240c9718dd58b4967c5114342a86c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75231f58b43240c9718dd58b4967c5114342a86c "0x75231f58b43240c9718dd58b4967c5114342a86c") (L1 Ethereum)|

## Deposit OKB and ERC-20 tokens from L1
The ZkEVM bridge contract allows ETH and ERC-20 token bridging from L1 to L2 using the bridgeAsset function. Notice that ERC-20 tokens will have a different address on L2. You can use the precalculatedWrapperAddress function to query the new address in [ZkEVMBridgeContract.sol](https://github.com/okx/x1-contracts/blob/release/v0.1.0/contracts/PolygonZkEVMBridge.sol "ZkEVMBridgeContract.sol") contract

### bridgeAsset
Deposit and add a new leaf to the Merkle tree:
```solidity
  function bridgeAsset(
    uint32 destinationNetwork,
    address destinationAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    address token,
    bool forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot,
    bytes permitData
  ) public
```
**Parameters**
|Name|Type|Description|
|:----|:----|:----|
|`destinationNetwork`|uint32|Network destination|
|`destinationAddress`|address|Address destination|
|`amount`|uint256|Amount of tokens|
|`token`|address|Token address, 0 address is reserved for ETH|
|`forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot`|bool|Indicates if the new global exit root is updated or not|
|`permitData`|bytes|Raw data of the call `permit` of the token|

### precalculatedWrapperAddress
This returns the precalculated address of a wrapper using the token information.
Note: Updating the metadata of a token is not supported.
Since the metadata has relevance in the address deployed, this function will not return a valid wrapped address if the metadata provided is not the original one.
```solidity
function precalculatedWrapperAddress(
    uint32 originNetwork,
    address originTokenAddress,
    string name,
    string symbol,
    uint8 decimals
  ) external returns (address)
```
**Parameters**
|Name|Type|Description|
|:----|:----|:----|
|`originNetwork`|uint32|Origin network|
|`originTokenAddress`|address|Origin token address, 0 address is reserved for ETH|
|`name`|string|Name of the token|
|`symbol`|string|Symbol of the token|
|`decimals`|uint8|Decimals of the token|

## Withdrawing OKB and ERC-20 tokens from L2
You can use the `claimAsset` method to retrieve assets on L2. Calling this method on L2 incurs no Gas fees, so the official bridge service will be provided to automatically invoke the `claimAsset` method for you.

### claimAsset
```solidity
 function claimAsset(
    bytes32[32] smtProof,
    uint32 index,
    bytes32 mainnetExitRoot,
    bytes32 rollupExitRoot,
    uint32 originNetwork,
    address originTokenAddress,
    uint32 destinationNetwork,
    address destinationAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes metadata
  ) external
```
**Parameters**
|Name|Type|Description|
|:----|:----|:----|
|`smtProof`|bytes32[32]|Smt proof|
|`index`|uint32|Index of the leaf|
|`mainnetExitRoot`|bytes32|Mainnet exit root|
|`rollupExitRoot`|bytes32|Rollup exit root|
|`originNetwork`|uint32|Origin network|
|`originTokenAddress`|address|Origin token address, 0 address is reserved for ETH|
|`destinationNetwork`|uint32|Network destination|
|`destinationAddress`|address|Address destination|
|`amount`|uint256`|Amount of tokens|
|`metadata`|bytes|Abi encoded metadata if any, empty otherwise|

# Bridge to Ethereum
## Creating an ERC-20 token with custom logic on X1 (L2)
ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is interchangeable with another token — whereas the well-known non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not interchangeable.
You can read more information about ERC-20 [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/ "here").
Deploy a simple ERC-20 contract with any of the tools like [Truffle](/developer/smart-contract/deploy-with-truffle "Truffle"), [Hardhat](/developer/smart-contract/deploy-with-hardhat "Hardhat"), or [Foundry](/developer/smart-contract/deploy-with-foundry "Foundry"). This contract is implemented based on the open-source library, which can be found at [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts# "OpenZeppelin").
```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.3/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}
```

## Depositing OKB and ERC-20 tokens from L2
The same bridge contract is used on both L1 and L2, so the interface definition is identical.
