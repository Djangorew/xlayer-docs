## Interpretation

        "standard": 1,
        "fast": 1,
        "fastest": 1,
        "blockTime": 2,
        "blockNumber": 308789
}
```

- {`safelow`, `standard`, `fast`, `fastest`} are gas prices in Gwei. Feel free to utilize these prices according to your requirements before submitting the transaction to the X1 testnet.
- `blockTime`, in seconds, gives the average block time of the network.
- `blockNumber` furnishes details about the most recent mined block at the time the recommendation was generated.
