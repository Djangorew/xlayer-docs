# Quickstart
In the following section, you will be guided through the process of initiating, creating and deploying your subgraph with **X1's Subgraph** service. By deploying the subgraph, you can explore the subgraph GraphQL API by issuing queries and viewing the schema.
The X1 testnet currently provides a **beta version** of the **Subgraph Hosted Service**. To deploy a subgraph on this service, please send your application to subgraph@okx.com and include the following information:

## FAQ
### What is a subgraph?
A subgraph is a specialized API created for blockchain data. Subgraphs are accessed using the GraphQL query language and are deployed to a Graph node using the Graph CLI. Once deployed and made public, subgraphs can be queried by subgraph consumers.

### Are there requirements for subgraph code？
- "@graphprotocol/graph-cli": "^0.20.1"
- "@graphprotocol/graph-ts": "^0.20.1"
- "npm": "^7.20.5"

### Is it not possible to deploy subgraphs with the same name?
Duplicated subgraph names are not allowed.

### Can I delete my subgraph?
Yes. You may contact the X1 support team to do that for you.

### Does the deployed subgraph support modifications or upgrades？
Yes. You may contact the X1 support team for further help.

### What are the limitations when querying the subgraph?​
There will be a query limit. If you encounter restricted flow or no response to the query, please reach out to the X1 support team.

### Do I need to pay for querying the subgraph?
Free for now.
