# Quickstart
Welcome to Xgon developer documentation.
Xgon is a zkEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by [Polygon CDK](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/cdk/ "Polygon CDK") - a zkEVM stack for building Ethereum L2 scaling solutions.
Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with a zero-knowledge proof to verify their validity.

## Why build on Xgon?
- **Boundless scalability**: enable ZK-powered DApps on Xgon, with 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment
- **Powered by OKX**: seamless OKX product integrations, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users and $25B+ assets in the OKX ecosystem
- **Security**: rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability
- **Low fee**: same coding experience as Ethereum, with 100x less in costs
- **Portal to Web3**: enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps
- **Powered by Polygon**: zkEVM Layer 2 based on Polygon CDK, ensuring near-instant finality, unified liquidity, and independent data availability

## What's the difference between building on Xgon vs. Ethereum for developers?
Building DApps on Xgon is just like building them on Ethereum. All you have to do is switch to the Xgon RPC and begin your development on Xgon, that offers faster transactions, lower costs, and robust security. Xgon offers a user experience similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for both developers and users. This means you won't need any new tools or wallets to create or use DApps on zkEVM.

<Tip title="Note">You can visit Polygon's [Differences between EVM and zkEVM](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkevm/protocol/evm-diff/ "Differences between EVM and zkEVM") for detailed differences in terms of supported EIPs, opcodes, and additional changes to build on zkEVM.</Tip>

## Acquiring testnet OKB
To start building on Xgon, you'll first need some testnet OKB. See the [Faucet guide](/getting-started/user-guide/get-testnet-okb-from-faucet "Faucet guide") for the steps to get testnet OKB on Xgon.

## Connecting to Xgon
You can add Xgon testnet by inputting the following network info:
|Properties|Network details|
|:----|:----|
|Network name|Xgon testnet|
|RPC URL|https://testrpc.xgon.io|
|Chain ID|195|
|Token symbol|OKB|
|Block explorer URL|https://www.oklink.com/xgon-test|

You can also simply add Xgon Testnet to MetaMask through [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/195 "Chainlist")

<Tip title="Note">Mainnet network info will be updated after Xgon is live on Mainnet.</Tip>

The next step is to [bridge your assets](/getting-started/user-guide/bridge "bridge your assets") from Ethereum â†’ Xgon. You can use the [Xgon Bridge](https://www.okx.com/xgon/bridge "Xgon Bridge") to bridge your assets.

## Deploying smart contracts
Developing on Xgon is seamless and identical to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Developers can use their existing code and toolings to deploy on Xgon with much better performance and lower fees.
