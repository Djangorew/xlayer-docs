# Price feed
You can use X Layer data feeds to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data such as the `BTC/USD`. These data feeds use data aggregated from many independent data sources. Each price feed has an onchain address and functions that enable contracts to read pricing data from that address.
## Using data feeds
The code for reading Data Feeds is the same across all EVM-compatible blockchains and Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for different uses, but the request and response format are the same. To read a feed, specify the following variables:
- RPC endpoint URL: This determines which network that your smart contracts will run on. You can use a node provider service or point to your own client. If you are using a Web3 wallet, it is already configured with the RPC endpoints for several networks and the Remix IDE will automatically detect them for you.
- Price feed contract address: This determines which data feed your smart contract will read on X Layer mainnet or testnet.
The examples in this document indicate these variables, but you can modify the examples to work on different networks and read different feeds.

The following guide will show an example that reads data feeds using the following languages:
- Onchain consumer contracts:
  - Solidity
  - Vyper

## Reading data feeds onchain
  These code examples demonstrate how to deploy a consumer contract onchain that reads a data feed and stores the value.
## Solidity
To consume price data, your smart contract should reference **AggregatorV3Interface**, which defines the external functions implemented by data feeds.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES HARDCODED
 * VALUES FOR CLARITY.
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

/**
 * If you are reading data feeds on L2 networks, you must
 * check the latest answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime
 * Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event
 * of an L2 sequencer outage. See the
 * https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
 * page for details.
 */

contract DataConsumerV3 {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal dataFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Sepolia
     * Aggregator: BTC/USD
     * Address: 0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
     */
    constructor() {
        dataFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
        );
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest answer.
     */
    function getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer() public view returns (int) {
        // prettier-ignore
        (
            /* uint80 roundID */,
            int answer,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            /*uint timeStamp*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();
        return answer;
    }
}
```
## Vyper
To use the price data, your smart contract should import `AggregatorV3Interface` which defines the external functions implemented by data feeds. You can find it [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.vy "Data feed smart contract"). You can also find a `PriceConsumer` example [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/PriceConsumer.vy "Price Consumer Contract"). Read the apeworx-starter-kit [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit "README") to learn how to run the example code.

## Using feed registry
The feed registry is an onchain mapping of assets to feeds. It enables you to query data feeds from asset addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses. They enable smart contracts to get the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.

For a complete list of functions and parameters for the `FeedRegistryInterface`, see the [Feed Registry API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry/feed-registry-functions "API Registry").

## Code example
### Solidity
To use the  price data from the feed registry, your smart contract should reference `FeedRegistryInterface`, which defines the external functions implemented by the feed registry.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import {FeedRegistryInterface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/FeedRegistryInterface.sol";
import {Denominations} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/Denominations.sol";

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES HARDCODED VALUES FOR CLARITY.
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

contract PriceConsumer {
    FeedRegistryInterface internal registry;

    /**
     * Network: Ethereum Mainnet
     * Feed Registry: 0x47Fb2585D2C56Fe188D0E6ec628a38b74fCeeeDf
     */
    constructor(address _registry) {
        registry = FeedRegistryInterface(_registry);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the ETH / USD price
     */
    function getEthUsdPrice() public view returns (int) {
        // prettier-ignore
        (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int price,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            /*uint timeStamp*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = registry.latestRoundData(Denominations.ETH, Denominations.USD);
        return price;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price
     */
    function getPrice(address base, address quote) public view returns (int) {
        // prettier-ignore
        (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int price,
            /*uint startedAt*/,
            /*uint timeStamp*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        return price;
    }
}
```
## Price feed contract addresses

To ensure accurate data is fed to the smart contracts in a timely manner, X Layer oracle will feed the price to the smart contracts in regards to two parameters: deviation threshold and heartbeat threshold:

- **Deviation threshold**: The deviation of crypto price data beyond a certain interval triggers smart contracts to update. 
- **Heartbeat threshold**: If the data values stay within the deviation parameters, it will only trigger an update every x minute.
