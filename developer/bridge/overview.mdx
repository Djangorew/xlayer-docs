# Xgon bridge overview
Xgon employs a flexible message bridge, allowing tokens to move and facilitating communication between layer 1 and layer 2 in a seamless manner. This empowers layer 1 DApps to initiate contract actions on layer 2, and vice versa. 
The Xgon zkEVM Bridge smart contract's main feature is the use of **Exit Trees** and the **Global Exit Tree**, with the **Global Exit Tree Root** as the primary source of state truth.
The use of two distinct **Global Exit Root managers** for L1 and L2, as well as separate logic for Bridge smart contract and each of these **Global Exit Root managers**, allows for extensive network interoperability.
Meanwhile, all asset transfers can be validated by any L1 and L2 nodes due to data availability.
The sections that follow explain how the Xgon zkEVM Bridge-related smart contracts ensure the security of assets transferred between the zkEVM and any network.
In the following section, we'll delve into the smart contract used for asset transfer, and the mechanics of sending message/assets across L1 and L2.
