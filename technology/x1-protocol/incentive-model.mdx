# Incentive mechanism
In X1, actors are rewarded for executing their jobs correctly and helping the protocol achieve finality.

<Tip title="Note">Unless stated otherwise, the incentive mechanism discussed here applies when the sequencer and aggregator roles are decentralized, meaning there are no trusted sequencers or aggregators involved.</Tip>

## L2 transaction fees and sequencing fees
The native token used in X1 is `Bridged OKB`, which originates from the Ethereum ERC-20 OKB. This is the token used to pay X1 transaction fees. It can be bridged at a 1:1 exchange rate from Ethereum to X1 and vice versa.
The **sequencer** plays a crucial role in the network and receives transaction fees paid by users on X1 when they submit transactions. These fees are paid in `Bridged OKB`. The exact fee amount depends on the Gas price set by users, indicating how much they are willing to pay for transaction execution.

To motivate the **aggregator** for each batch it sequences, the **sequencer** is required to lock a specific number of OKB tokens in the L1 `ZkEVM.sol` contract. The number of tokens locked per batch is determined by the variable `batchFee`. The final aggregator reward is distributed from `[ZkEVM.sol](https://github.com/okx/x1-contracts/blob/release/v0.1.0/contracts/PolygonZkEVM.sol "ZkEVM.sol")` in the form of L1 OKB tokens.

The diagram below illustrates the different fees and rewards earned by participants within the protocol.

<Tip title="Note">X1 uses the same incentive mechanism â€” or detailed rewarding formula for sequencers and aggregators, as Polygon zkEVM does.
