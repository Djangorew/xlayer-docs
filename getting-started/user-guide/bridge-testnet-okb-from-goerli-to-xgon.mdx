# Bridge Testnet OKB from Sepolia to Xgon
**Xgon faucet** is the official tool provided by the Xgon team for developers to claim test tokens. Developers can use Xgon faucet to obtain **testnet OKB  tokens** and other ERC-20 tokens.
Users can mint a certain amount of testnet OKB on the Sepolia testnet and then use our official Xgon bridge to bridge OKB (or other test tokens) from Sepolia to the Xgon testnet. 
<Tip title="Note">Please ensure that your wallet contains enough ETH (Sepolia ETH) for gas fees on the Sepolia network. You can also use the Xgon bridge to bridge ETH to the Xgon testnet.</Tip>

## How to claim ETH
You can obtain ETH from the following third-party faucets, each with its own claiming requirements. Choose the one that suits your needs:
- [Quick Node](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)
- [Alchemy](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
If you have already claimed ETH, you can switch your wallet network to the Sepolia network and check if the ETH has been credited. If you are using the OKX Wallet, you need to enable **Settings - Custom network** and select the Sepolia network.
