# Get testnet OKB from faucet
Despite bridging OKB from Sepolia to X1 testnet, you can directly input your wallet address on the [X1 testnet faucet](http://www.okx.com/x1/faucet "X1 testnet faucet") and claim a small fixed amount of OKB.

<Tip title="Note">Please note that on the X1 testnet, each user can only claim **0.2 OKB per day**.</Tip>

## How to claim OKB
1. Go to the X1 testnet faucet official website and click the **Get OKB in X1** button to proceed.
