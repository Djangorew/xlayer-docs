# Get Testnet OKB from Faucet
Despite bridging OKB from Sepolia to Xgon testnet, you can directly input your wallet address on the Xgon faucet and claim a small fixed amount of OKB.
<Tip title="Note">
Please note that on the Xgon testnet, each user can only claim 0.2 OKB per day.
</Tip>

## How to claim OKB
1. Go to the Xgon faucet official website and click the **Get OKB in Xgon** button to proceed.
